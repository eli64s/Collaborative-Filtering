# Collaborative-Filtering
This script creates a recommendation engine that gives users travel option. This notebook uses arbitrary data, but is carefully modeled to replicate real airline travel data. 

The data we will be working with includes:
-User ID                
-Origin
-Destination
-Destination ID
-Destination Region

Implicit Data is data gathered by user behavior - in this example the user's previous flights destinations/regions. Explicit Data is more common in reccomendation systems using data based on a type of rating such as a streaming service.
