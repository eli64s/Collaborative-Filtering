# Collaborative-Filtering
This script creates a recommendation engine that gives users travel options based off other user's histroy. This notebook uses mock data, but is carefully modeled to replicate real airline travel data.

The data we will be working with includes:
- User ID
- Origin
- Destination
- Origin Destination ID
- Destination Region

Implicit Data is used in this script, which is data gathered by user behavior - in this example the user's previous flights destinations/regions. Explicit Data is more common in reccomendation systems using data based on a type of rating such as a streaming service.

This recommendation engine is still a work in progress so feel free to leave comments and suggestions!
