# Collaborative-Filtering
I developed a recommendation engine using Collaborative Filtering that yields user travel destination options. I work for an airline and the travel perks drove the inspiration of this project, however the data used in this notebook is ARBITRARY, but carefully created to model real airline travel data. 

The data we will be working with includes:
    1) user_id
    2) destination_id
    3) destination
    4) destination_region
    5) season
